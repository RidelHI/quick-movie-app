# Workspace Instructions

Use the Angular CLI MCP server when available for Angular-specific guidance and patterns.

Reference these files for project context and conventions:

- AI_CONTEXT.md
- ANGULAR_BEST_PRACTICES.md

Project-specific rules:

- Standalone components (default in Angular 20+). Do not set standalone: true.
- Prefer inject() over constructor injection.
- Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush on components.
- Keep DTOs, models, and mappers separated by folder.
- Avoid putting API logic in UI components; use stores/services.
