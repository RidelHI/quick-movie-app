# Workspace Instructions

Use the Angular CLI MCP server when available for Angular-specific guidance and patterns.

Reference these files for project context and conventions:

- AI_CONTEXT.md
- ANGULAR_BEST_PRACTICES.md

Project-specific rules:

- Standalone components (default in Angular 20+). Do not set standalone: true.
- Prefer inject() over constructor injection.
- Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush on components.
- Keep DTOs, models, and mappers separated by folder.
- Avoid putting API logic in UI components; use stores/services.

Collaboration and visibility defaults:

- Explain intent before substantial actions (what will be checked/changed and why).
- Share short progress updates while working, especially after each discovery or command batch.
- Before editing files, state which files will change and the purpose of each change.
- Before running tests/build commands, state the command and expected outcome.
- After each command batch, summarize key findings (not raw noise).
- End each task with: files changed, validations run, result, and next optional steps.
